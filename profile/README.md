# Gen3

The University of Chicago, Center for Translational Data Science is the maintainer organization for the open-source Gen3 Data Platform.  Some useful references are included below to help you learn more about Gen3.

## How to ask questions of the Gen3 community

Join the Gen3 community on [slack](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczyhhOXeCK9FdVtpQpelOHYnRj1EAq1rwwnm9q6cPAe5a7ug/viewform) or via the [discussion board](https://forums.gen3.org/) to ask questions about how to use or contribute to Gen3.

## How to contribute code to Gen3

Gen3 software is completely open-source.  Please refer to our [Contributor Guidelines](https://uc-cdis.github.io/gen3-docs/docs/Contributor%20Guidelines/) for how to contribute code to our repositories.

## How to set-up and operate a Gen3 data commons or mesh

Gen3 on [Helm](https://github.com/uc-cdis/gen3-helm) is the new preferred way to run a Gen3 commons on a single laptop, desktop, or VM. Using Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes, Gen3 can be installed against any cluster, including a local one such as Minikube or Rancher Desktop. This option is suitable for those that wish to experiment with Gen3, develop against it on their machines, or other non-production uses. At this time, the Helm deployment is not considered production-ready. If you are ready to get started, you can follow our guide [here](https://github.com/uc-cdis/gen3-helm/blob/doc/gen3Setup/gen3ForDevs/gen3HelmForDevelopers.md). 

To learn more please refer to our [Operator's Guidelines](https://gen3.org/resources/operator/).

## Learn More about the Center for Translational Data Science

The Center for Translational Data Science at the University of Chicago is developing the discipline of data science and its applications to problems in biology, medicine, healthcare and the environment. We develop and operate large scale data platforms to support research in topics of societal interest including cancer, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), birth defects, veterans’ health, pain management, opioid use disorder, and environmental science. We also develop new machine learning and AI algorithms over the data in our platforms. 

Our center has been at the forefront of data sharing by continuously leveraging new approaches and new technology to enable world class science in a variety of fields. We have developed a number of important firsts: including one of the first large scale data clouds (NSF supported Open Science Data Cloud (2010-2016)), the first data cloud designed to host biomedical data and approved as a NIH Trusted Partner (Bionimbus Protected Data Cloud (2013-present)), the first large scale data commons (National Cancer Institute’s Genomic Data Commons (2016-present)), and the first set of services to create data ecosystems or meshes for biomedical data (Data Commons Frameworks Services for the Cancer Research Data Commons (2020-present)). 

Today with our partners, we operate a data ecosystem comprising over 20 data commons that make over 17 PB of data available to the research community from nearly 1.7M patients. We provide access to this data via secure and compliant workspaces, while protecting patient privacy. These are all based on the open-source Gen3 data platform, that includes the Gen3 data commons, Gen3 Framework Services, and Gen3 Workspaces.

We are based in Chicago, but our work engages collaborators from across the world.
